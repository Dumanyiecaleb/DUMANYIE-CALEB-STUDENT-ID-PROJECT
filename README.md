# DUMANYIE-CALEB-STUDENT-ID-PROJECT
A CODE THAT STORES STUDENTS NAME,MATRIC NUMBER ,LEVEL AND OTHER DETAILS
Student ID Card Management System 

NAME: DUMANYIE - CALEB - BARISUA MATRIC NO : 24/15078  DEPARTMENT : COMPUTER - SCIENCE 

Project Overview 

The Student ID Card Management System is a simple console-based Python application designed to register students, generate student ID cards, and verify student IDs. This project demonstrates a full implementation of a real-life system while following proper Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices. 

 

SDLC of the Project 

1. Requirement Analysis 

Identify the need for a system to manage student ID cards. 

Key requirements: 

Register students with basic details (Name, Matric Number, Department, Level). 

Generate student ID cards for all registered students. 

Verify a student’s ID using their Matric Number. 

Simple and terminal-based system to run without external libraries. 

2. System Design 

Modules / Components: 

StudentRegistrationModule – handles student registration. 

IDCardGenerationModule – generates and displays ID cards. 

IDVerificationModule – verifies a student ID. 

MainMenu – allows user navigation between modules. 

Data Storage: In-memory list students (no external database required). 

Design Nomenclature: Module names in the design match the function names in the code. 

3. Implementation 

Implemented as a single Python file (student_id_system.py). 

Uses Python’s built-in input() function for user interaction. 

Stores students in a list of dictionaries in memory. 

Functions for each module correspond directly to the design components. 

4. Testing 

Manual testing performed by running the program: 

Registering multiple students. 

Viewing generated ID cards. 

Verifying valid and invalid student IDs. 

Ensured all menu options work as intended. 

5. Deployment 

The program is terminal-based and can run on any system with Python 3 installed. 

No external dependencies required. 

6. Maintenance 

Easy to extend: 

Could add file-based persistence or a database. 

Could add GUI interface in future versions. 

 

Project Modules 

Module Name 

Functionality 

StudentRegistrationModule 

Registers new students by taking Name, Matric, Department, and Level. 

IDCardGenerationModule 

Displays a formatted student ID card for each registered student. 

IDVerificationModule 

Checks if a student exists in the system using their Matric Number. 

MainMenu 

Provides a terminal-based menu to access all modules. 

 

How to Run the Project 

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. 

Save the project file as: 

student_id_system.py 
 

Open terminal / command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the file. 

Run the program: 

python student_id_system.py 

Use the menu to: 

Register students (1) 

Generate ID cards (2) 

Verify student IDs (3) 

Exit the program (4) 

 

Example Run 

=== Student ID Card Management === 
1. Register Student 
2. Generate ID Cards 
3. Verify Student ID 
4. Exit 
Enter your choice (1-4): 1 
 
--- Register Student --- 
Enter Full Name: DUMANYIE CALEB BARISUA

Enter Department: Computer Science 
Enter Level: 200 
Student Registered Successfully! 
 

 

GitHub Instructions 

Initialize Git in your project folder: 

git init 
git add student_id_system.py 
git commit -m "Initial commit - Student ID Card Management System" 

Link your GitHub repository: 

git remote add origin https://github.com/bendaniel5446/SEN-201-SCHOOL-ID-CARD-.git

Notes 

This is a terminal-based project, no external libraries required. 

Module names in the design and implementation are consistent for easy understanding. 

Can be extended to support file storage, databases, or GUI interfaces.
